# LDPC_coding_theory
McKay Neal algorithms used simplified sum product algorithm to code the message, send it on the channel and decode the recieved code. Recieved code maybe has some errors. The algorithm uses iterations till the full zero code achieves and the process stops. The full zero matrix shows us the errors solved.
